   - Solution: 
     - Implemented proper `scroll_screen` function
     - Fixed cursor position tracking
     - Enhanced screen buffer management
   - Code Changes:
     ```c
     // Added scroll_screen function to copy lines upward
     // Enhanced print_char and print_string for proper scrolling
     ```

2. **Command Input and Parsing**
   - Problem: Difficulty with quoted arguments in commands
   - Error: Could not write text with spaces to files
   - Solution:
     - Modified shell parsing to handle both single and double quotes
     - Updated `parse_command` function in shell.c
     - Added better command usage messages
   - Example Fix:
     ```
     write myfile.txt 'Hello World'
     write myfile.txt "Hello World"
     ```

3. **File System Persistence**
   - Problem: Files not being saved after system shutdown

## Error Resolution and Running Instructions

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **Screen Buffer Issues**
   - Error: Previous commands disappearing at screen bottom
   - Resolution Steps:
     ```c
     // 1. Implemented scroll_screen function
     void scroll_screen() {
         // Copy each line up
         // Clear bottom line
         // Reset cursor position
     }
     
     // 2. Modified print functions to handle scrolling
     void print_char(char c) {
         // Check if need to scroll
         if (cursor_y >= SCREEN_HEIGHT) {
             scroll_screen();
         }
     }
     ```
   - Testing: Write long commands or multiple commands to verify scrolling

2. **Command Parsing Errors**
   - Error: "Cannot write text with spaces" when using write command
   - Resolution:
     ```c
     // Added quote handling in parse_command
     // Example usage:
     write myfile.txt "Hello World"  // Now works
     write myfile.txt 'Hello World'  // Also works
     ```
   - Testing: Try writing files with spaces in content

3. **File System Limitations**
   - Error: Files lost after system restart
   - Current Limitation: In-memory storage only
   - Workaround: Save important files before shutdown
   - Future Enhancement: Implement disk persistence

   help             # Shows available commands
   create file.txt  # Creates new file
   write file.txt "content"  # Writes to file
   read file.txt    # Reads file content
   ls               # Lists files
   clear            # Clears screen
   ```

2. **File Operations**
   - Create files: `create filename`
   - Write content: `write filename "content"`
   - Read files: `read filename`
   - Note: All files are temporary (in-memory)

3. **Screen Management**
   - Screen automatically scrolls when full
   - Backspace works for editing
   - Clear screen with `clear` command

4. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid commands show usage message
